# FAQs for Python Training Course

## What will be the workshop schedule?

Each topic lasts 2 hours and includes a walk-through of the theoretical concepts, a hands-on session and Q&A. At the end of each day we will have 1 extra hour to answer additional questions.

## Which operating system should I use?

There is no specific requirement for the operating system. The training will be conducted on [binder](https://mybinder.org/) using Jupyter notebooks, which are browser-based, so an updated browser is the only requirement. Chrome-based or Firefox usually work better with Jupyter notebooks, but this is only a suggestion.

## Do I have to install any software beforehand?

There is no specific software that you have to install before the training. However, if you prefer having a local Python installation, you can do that.

## Is there a recommended Python installation?

If you plan to install Python locally, we recommend using Python 3.8 at the minimum. If possible, use Python 3.13.

## Will the workshop cover the topic X?

The workshop will cover the fundamentals of the language, and the topics we will explore include:

Basic:
- Basic syntax and data types
- Control flow, loops, and exceptions
- Functions
- File handling
- Object-oriented programming
- Modules and packages

Advanced:
- Manage Python project
- Advanced functions
- Functional programming
- Advanced Object-oriented programming
- Parallelism and concurrency
- Libraries
