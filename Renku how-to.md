#### How to start with Renku

1. Click on Login at top right corner of [renkulab.io](http://renkulab.io). You need an edu-ID account, a GitHub account, or an ORCID account.

2. Come back to this page and click on the green “**Launch**” button in the **Sessions** section to start the course session. Be aware that launching the environment may take a few minutes.

3. Inside your session, you will find the folders directory at the left, and you can now navigate through the course material by clicking on the folder “data-visualization-intro”. You can now access the notebooks like "*handson_B_SAXS_height_dependence_Wang.ipynb*" and explore the course content!

#### How to pause and terminate your work
Sessions continue active even if you close your browser. Be mindful of the resources when you finish your work:

* **Pause Session**: When you click on the Pause button in a running session (top-left corner), all the files and changes you made in the workspace are preserved for two weeks. Your session also goes to Pause automatically after 2 hours of inactivity.

* **Shut Down Session**: When you click on  "*Shut Down Session*"  in a running session (top-left corner), only the files that you have stored in a [Data Connector](https://renku.notion.site/Data-connector-3ae1e46fdb094cc48516a104457e5633) or pushed to your code repository will be kept. Any other changes in your workspace will be lost.

Please note that even if sessions are paused, **your session might be terminated unexpectedly**: e.g. if there are any server updates or issues in the service occur. Therefore, save your work in data folders or download notebooks and data you want to preserve to your own computer using the left menu.

#### Get all the recent changes from the GitHub repository

When you launch a new session, the GitHub repository is copied, and you have all the latest changes. However, these **changes are not pulled when your session is still running or paused**. You can keep your changed notebooks and pull additional ones in the following way.

* Go to "**Git**" in the left menu bar and click on "**Pull latest changes**":
